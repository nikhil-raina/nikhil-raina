### Hey —I’m Nikhil! 👋  

Cloud-first full-stack engineer turning ambitious ideas into production systems that **move electrons, bytes, and people**. I’ve spent the last four years at Ample building the frontend, backend and cloud infra that powers Ample's EV battery-swap stations worldwide

#### 🚀  A few wins I’m proud of
| What | Why it was fun |
|------|----------------|
| **Ground-up Monolith** | Re-platforming high traffic microservices by designing and migrating core data models for OEMs, fleets and drivers (Node.js, MongoDB, React, MQTT) |
| **Config Manager** | Designed a self-healing Node.js + MQTT service with a React RBAC console that rolls out configs to 50 + stations in *< 5 min* and cut on-call toil **90 %**. |
| **Start Swap on Mobile** | Zero-touch driver workflow that boosted station throughput **~21 %** via silent push, IoT Core, and MongoDB Atlas. |

#### 🔧  Toolbox
`AWS · Kubernetes · Node.js · React / TypeScript · Spring Boot · MQTT · MongoDB · MySQL · LevelDB · Apache Spark`  

(I get equally intrigued by clean domain models *and* a well-placed kubectl.)
